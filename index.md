# My garden bed
Hello. Have fun copying my notes.

---
Very happy birthday to a certain “Prawn” and “an egg on frying pan”. I wish they have a great day today, and that continues on for the rest of the year as well. Best wishes; good luck.

Have a good one,
\- spicata :)

p.s. Blob Farmer will never come out.

%%Although, you should note some things about this place. First of all, notes marked with "#raw" means that they are raw notes, littered with bullet points and incomplete sentences. These notes, are not particularly useful, only useful for me, so you may want to keep on the non-raw notes.

Also, this website is completely safe, and respects your privacy. We do not sell your data, and there are no cookies, because I do not know how to make them and too lazy to bother trying.

As well as that, I know that this is a part of the [Notes Coalition, and is found on the HubNote](https://notes-coalition.github.io/), and I am also aware that I essentially started this “Notes Coalition” thing, however, I continue to work on these notes independently.

You may ask: “Why is everything only connected by hyperlinks? Can you not just make an easy organising system?” To that, I say: “No.”%%
