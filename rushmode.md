# Rush Mode
What’s that? You need answers, asap? Sure.

Rush mode is for when you need answers, but don’t have the time to read the more lengthy notes (say, you have a test tomorrow ~~did you procrastinate~~). What these notes lack in depth, it makes up in speed ~~and copyability~~. These are probably not the best notes to be learning from. If you have time and need to learn, you should probably just go the regular notes, unless I do not have the non-rushed alternative.
