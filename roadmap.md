# Roadmap
## Things to add
- ~~“Rush Mode”~~
- Getting a niche
- ~~Better commits~~
- More fancy CSS
	- ~~Justified text~~
	- ~~Sticky header~~
	- Theme Switcher (← This broke me)
	- Banner Photos
- Better:
	- ~~**bold**~~
	- ~~*italics*,~~
	- ~~strikethrough (check?),~~
	- link, and 
	- ~~<mark style="background: #398D42A6;">“highlight”</mark> styling.~~
- Bug Fixes:
	- No highlight + other formatting compatibility
	- ~~Strange ratio on some mobile devices.~~
## Hopes:
- Cutting back on page load times (1.5 for first load and 0.4 for subsequent loads are not good enough.)
- Cutting back on bloat. Sure, the philosophy notes were okay, except they are way to bloated.

Maybe I’ll go on a break, come out better. Do not expect updates for a while. I’m gonna take time to work on my ideas. I mean, it’s already been… what, 2 months in? But it doesn’t really feel anything has changed.
