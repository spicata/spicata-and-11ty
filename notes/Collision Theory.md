# Collision Theory #raw
The collision theory was proposed by both **Max Trautz** in 1916 and **William Lewis** in 1918. It was the idea that *particles must collide for reactions* to occur, however there were some additional criteria that had to be met for a reaction to occur:
1. The particles must collide with enough energy (activation energy)
2. They must the right orientation for some reactions

Due to collision theory
- Particles must collide for reactions to occur
- They must also have enough energy
	- This is called activation energy
- an increase in temperature means faster reaction
- they must also have the right orientation for some reactions
