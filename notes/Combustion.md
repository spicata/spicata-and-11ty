# Combustion
Combustion is a form of reaction where a compound reacts with oxygen, producing light and heat. Complete combustion occurs when there is plenty enough oxygen to complete the reaction, coming in the form:
> Hydrogen + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> + energy [[Balancing Combustion|(looks complicated)]]

On the other hand, when there is not enough oxygen, it will undergo incomplete combustion, that still yields CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>, but also creates CO and C as by-products. These by-products are toxic.
