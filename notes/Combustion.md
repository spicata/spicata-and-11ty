# Combustion
Combustion is a form of reaction where a compound reacts with oxygen, producing light and heat. Complete combustion occurs when there is plenty enough oxygen to complete the reaction, coming in the form:
	Hydrogen + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> + energy

On the other hand, when there is not enough oxygen, it will undergo incomplete combustion, that still yields CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>, but also creates CO and C as by-products. These by-products are toxic.
## Balancing Combustion
Combustion reactions are rather hard to balance, due to the large amount of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen atoms on each side, thus, I have ~~copied~~ "prepared" a simple way to balance combustion.
1. Write the equation, e.g.:
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
2. Then, list the amount of each element on each side, e.g.:
	- C: 4 / C: 1
	- H: 10 / H: 2
	- O: 2 / O: 3
3. Then balance all other elements **EXCEPT** oxygen, and list the amount of  each element there is (again), e.g.:
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 4CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
		- C: 4 / C: 4
		- H: 10 /  H: 10
		- O: 2 / O: 13
4. Finally, add the oxygens on the right hand side count to the left hand side oxygens, then double everything else, e.g.:
	- 2C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + 13O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 8CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
