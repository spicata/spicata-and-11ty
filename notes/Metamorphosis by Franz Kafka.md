# Metamorphosis
by Franz Kafka

Metamorphosis grapples with the absurdist idea of “What if you woke up as a giant insect”, however, despite being an absurdist novella, it contains large amount of depth about several ideas.

---
Metamorphosis firstly explores **alienation**, such as that shown towards Gregor Samsa by his family. Due to being an insect, he is unable to communicate in any meaningful way with his family, and his family finds him repulsive, and thus is separated from his family and his previous life.

---
Gregor Samsa also shows **self-reproach** and **shame** due to his new life as an insect, and his loss of identity due to lack of human interaction. Furthermore, he is ashamed of his own appearance, as reflected by Kafka, who never states what insect he became.

---
Gregor’s **relationship with his father** seems **tenuous** at best, and his father commits acts of violence towards Gregor as his time as an insect; it is also alluded that their relationship with his father was like this before his "metamorphosis". This is a direct reflection of Franz Kafka's troubled ties with his actual father.
