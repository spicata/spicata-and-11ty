# The Dreaming
- The Dreaming is very sophisticated
- Moral point of view (care of the soul)
	- Passed on by stories + virtues (fable)
- Difference from western culture could be because of geography
- Many cultures and languages have collapsed because colonists
- "*Question everything*" might not exist in The Dreaming
- "*The truth will set you free*" is present in Indigenous Australia culture 
	- Not about empirical (like Chemistry)
	- Truths about (friendship, family)
- What is a totem???

---
- There is quite a high knowledge barrier, it is insulated/closed off to other cultures
	- Secretive
	- Thus, there is no good explanation as of yet
- English is not great at representing Aboriginal culture
## Aboriginal Spirituality
### Animism
Aboriginal Spirituality is animistic, meaning that there are intangible spirits that affect the course of nature
- Nothing is inanimate
- Human = nature = animals
	- Respect
- Respect for spirits creates gain
	- Rain, hunting, eg
- Disrespect causes loss

---
- Pre-industrial communities have to take care of the environment
	- *Not that they can do much to it though*
- Animals and plants are living, breathing things; not resources to be used.
- Everything is connected
	- For the community
### Cosmogony
- How the Earth came to be
	- Explored in 'Dreamtime'
		- Many deities (part human (mind), part animal (body), part supernatural (powers)) form the Universe
- Interactions between deities (spirits?) made the Earth the way it is
- Everything is made for a reason
#### What is the Dreaming
- In the beginning, the world was very "mixed up", very different to what it is now.
- Ancestor (anthropomorphs) brought the world into order (from chaos)
- They made life:
	- Geographical features, animals, and humans, are all descendants of these ancestors
### Earthly
- It is sustainable, strict social contracts for life
	- Respect of kin, of land, and for spirits
- "The Law" is just a social contract essentially.

---
- Equally as complex as other religions
### Totemic
> A totem might make you a steward of a part of the environment.

- Totems are an inherited thing that represents a spirit
	- Defines person's role in life
- Responsible for the totems
- Very important
	- Can be decided before birth

---
- Resting places and descendants of the great beings became totems
- Totems create a sense of identity in Indigenous culture
	- through understanding themselves in terms of totems
	- Obligated and responsible for totems
- Through totemism, everything is part of a whole
- Aboriginal culture is more linked to time than place
	- Chronological order based on directions)

---
- Many ceremonies
	- Increase (ties to land) ceremony
	- Initiation (of people into culture) rites
	- Mourning (spirits to guide them back) ceremonies
	- Healing and harming (others using spirits)
### Oral
- Passed down by oral tradition
	- Lack of writing, lots of speaking
### Hierarchical
- I haven't quite understood yet.
- Elders, Custodians, stewardships, rank
	- Some people are more essential than others to the culture.
## Colonial Perspective vs Now
- European colonist describes Aboriginal Australian cultures as:
	- Stone-age-like
	- Pre-literate
	- Undeveloped
	- Rudimentary
- But Aboriginal culture is now widely accepted to the longest continuous culture(s) in the history of the world. (80,000 years)
	- They were able to overcome the risk of over-exploiting nature
- Religious practices inform actions in a Aboriginal person's day to day life.
	- Known as "The Law"
