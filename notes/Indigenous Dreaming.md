- The Dreaming is very sophisticated
- Moral point of view (care of the soul)
	- Passed on by stories + virtues (fable)

- Many cultures and languages have collapsed because colonists
- "*Question everything*" might not exist in The Dreaming
- "*The truth will set you free*" is present in Indigenous Australia culture 
	- Not about empirical (like Chemistry)
	- Truths about (friendship, family)
- What is a totem??? [^1]

---
- There is quite a high knowledge barrier, it is insulated/closed off to other cultures
	- Secretive

## Aboriginal Spirituality
### Animism
: (noun) the attribution of souls to inanimate objects

Aboriginal spirituality is animistic, which entails the attribution of spirits to nature, that can affect the course of it. This puts humans, nature, and animals on equal footing, thus respect is formed.

Respect for the spirits creates gain for society, such that it may bring about rain or aid in hunting. Additionally, disrespect causes loss; an unbountiful harvest, an unfruitful hunt.

---
Since Aboriginal communities were pre-industrial, the needed to take care of the environment, and treat animals and plants as living, breathing things; not resources to be used.
### The Law
*The Law*, also known as *The Lore* or *Aboriginal Customary Law* is a social contract that Aboriginal societies live by. These include things that people must or must not do, and, unlike European societies with their court structures, it is decided upon by the Elders of a community.
### Cosmogony

- How the Earth came to be
	- Explored in 'Dreamtime'
		- Many deities (part human (mind), part animal (body), part supernatural (powers)) form the Universe
- Interactions between deities (spirits?) made the Earth the way it is
- Everything is made for a reason [^1]
#### What is the Dreaming
The Dreaming, or the Dreamtime, is the Aboriginal's understanding of the world and its creation. It goes:
> In the beginning, the world was very "mixed up", very different to what it is now, however, grand ancestor — anthropomorphs — brought the world into order. Geographical features, animals, and humans, are all descendants of these ancestors

Thus totemism and animism are born.
### Earthly
- It is sustainable, strict social contracts for life
	- Respect of kin, of land, and for spirits
- "The Law" is just a social contract essentially. [^1]

---
- Equally as complex as other religions
### Totemic
: (noun) relating to or resembling a totem or totems.

A totem is an inherited thing that represents a spirit, that defines person's role in life. A totem might make you a steward of a part of the environment; thus people are responsible for them. Interestingly, these totem can be decided before births.

Totems are often the resting places and descendants of the great beings, which creates a sense of identity in Indigenous culture by allowing them to understand themselves in terms of the totems.

- Resting places and descendants of the great beings became totems
- Totems create a sense of identity in Indigenous culture
	- through understanding themselves in terms of totems
	- Obligated and responsible for totems
- Through totemism, everything is part of a whole
- Aboriginal culture is more linked to time than place
	- Chronological order based on directions) [^2]

---
- Many ceremonies

	- Initiation (of people into culture) rites
	- Mourning (spirits to guide them back) ceremonies
	- Healing and harming (others using spirits) [^2]
### Oral 
- Passed down by oral tradition
	- Lack of writing, lots of speaking [^1]
### Hierarchical
- I haven't quite understood yet. [^1]
- Elders, Custodians, stewardships, rank
	- Some people are more essential than others to the culture. [^2]
## Colonial Perspective vs Now
- European colonist describes Aboriginal Australian cultures as:
	- Stone-age-like
	- Pre-literate
	- Undeveloped
	- Rudimentary
- But Aboriginal culture is now widely accepted to the longest continuous culture(s) in the history of the world. ([[How did the Indigenous Australians Get Here|80,000 years]])
	- They were able to overcome the risk of over-exploiting nature
- Religious practices inform actions in a Aboriginal person's day to day life.
	- Known as "The Law" [^2]
