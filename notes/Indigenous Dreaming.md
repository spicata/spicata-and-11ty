# The Dreaming
- The Dreaming is very sophisticated
- Moral point of view (care of the soul)
	- Passed on by stories + virtues (fable)
- Difference from western culture could be because of geography
- Many cultures and languages have collapsed
- "*Question everything*" might not exist in The Dreaming
- "*The truth will set you free*" is present in Indigenous Australia culture 
	- Not about empirical (like Chemistry)
- What is a totem???
