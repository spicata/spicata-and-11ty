# Teaching and Aboriginal Languages #Literature 
- Language shapes learning, and learning should be moulded by language; this is a strong pedagogy.
- Aboriginal languages, though different, have some similarities, such as the concept that autonomy and social guidance should be balanced.
- When the pedagogy of two cultures overlap, and this is accounted for, valuable learning occurs.
- When information is integrated into stories, it can facilitate better learning.
- Nature and geographical landmarks can act as a map or inspiration for a project.
- Silence acts as a good learning method, as it allows us to consolidate our learning, and allows experience to take over as a teacher.
- Non-verbal signs are also a great way to learn, such as the image found underneath, which shows how these aspects are not static steps but interconnected dynamic processes.
