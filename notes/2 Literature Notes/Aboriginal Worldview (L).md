# Aboriginal Worldview #Literature 
- The land in the Aboriginal worldview holds great spiritual significance, and their lives are dependent on it. (The Law)
- Aboriginal society is based on the idea of (kinship) clans, where everyone has responsibility to the clan.
- Massive and ancient spirits, awakened from their slumber, formed the land through their actions among each other, and taught humanity about the Law. They would become the ancestors of everything in Australia.
- Everyone contains a part of the powers of these spirits, and therefore responsible for the descendants of them.
- Aboriginal’s worldview is focused on the long-term benefits and detriments, and how this can be integrated into society.
