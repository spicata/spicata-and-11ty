# Philosophy
> "The junkyard of the other disciplines" - Dr Driehuis

Philosophy is not a discipline, it is more of a natural human disposition; the pursuit of problems and subsequent pursuit of answers. On top of that, it looks into reality, knowledge, and existence, as well as many other topics.
## Branches
### Logic...
... is the study of reasoning and good arguments, often in a numerical or scientific sense. Assumptions and such.
### Ethics...
... is the study of morality, the study of good character. *You know what it is*
### Epistemology...
... is the study of knowledge, its nature, scope, and origin.
### Metaphysics...
... is the study of realism as well as abstract "things". What is something real? Religion often contains metaphysical things, such as a deity.

## Notable Philosophers
### Socrates
>"The unexamined life is not worth living" - Socrates

Socrates was born in Athens, Greece in 470 BC, well known for being put to death for his philosophy (399 BC). Most everything we know about Socrates was due to the *Socratic dialogue* by Plato.

---
Socrates believed that thinking logically would benefit humanity. He observed that his fellow Athenians often simply followed other - the majority or those of power. Instead, he believed that people should be confident in their own beliefs. 

Following this, he also found that people accept popular opinion, regardless of whether they are well thought out or not. Socrates was against this thought, and believed that humans should think logically and with reason. *In this sense, he would disapprove of modern politics.*

---
Socrates would be executed due to his beliefs, drinking hemlock and dying from the paralysis caused.
#### Socrates' Pottery
1. Look for common sense statements
2. Find a way to contradict it naturally
	1. If the exception works, then the statement is not true
3. Change initial statement to accommodate contradiction
4. Repeat

This method would take you closer to the universal truth
#### tl;dr
- Care of the soul
- Question everything - do not follow the majority (ignorance/stupidity)
- The truth/reason will set you free
- Back yourself up as an individual thinker

> "I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world." - Socrates
### Aristotle
> Happiness is good I guess
### Rene Descartes 
> Mind is indivisible or something

## The Greeks and Democracy
The Ancient Greeks were distrustful of democracy because they believed that it could have descended into tyranny (dictatorship) easily. This was because democracy relies too heavily on human emotions, which can bring rise to demagogues - a political leader that appeals to desires of the people rather than logic.
