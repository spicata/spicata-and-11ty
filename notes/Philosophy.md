Philosophy is not a discipline, it is more of a natural human disposition; the pursuit of problems and subsequent pursuit of answers; unlikely to ever run out. On top of that, it looks into reality, knowledge, and existence, as well as many other topics.

The invention of philosophy is often credited back to a [[Socrates|certain Athenian philosopher]].
