# Creation of Oils and Gases
Crude oils are formed when ancient organisms die (such as the plankton in oceans 100 million years ago), and settle on the ocean floor, where they will turn into **kerogen**, which can further turn into crude oils and natural gases. This occurs due to the high temperatures and pressures that exists at this depth under the ground.

These oils and gases will occasionally break the surface, but often are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers of hard rock, making reservoirs, which is detected by seismic surveying and other methods, and extracted.
