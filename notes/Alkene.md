# Alkene
Alkenes are a group of hydrocarbons that make up a homologous series that each contain one double bond between two carbon atoms. When arranged in straight-lines, it has a general formula of: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. However, due to the nature of the double bond, they have a key difference from alkanes.
## Cis and trans

Unlike single bonds, double bonds cannot be rotated, thus, there are difference depending on which way the parent chain continues. These are cis and trans isomers. Cis isomers have the parent chain on the same “side” of the double bond, whilst trans isomers continue the parent chain on opposite sides.
