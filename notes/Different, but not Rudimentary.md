# Different, but not rudimentary
Aboriginal culture was described as rudimentary, and the notion of the Dreaming was described as childish. However, we now know that this was not the case, as the Dreamtime contains a near endless wealth of information passed down for tens of thousands of years. This begs the question, why did the Europeans believe that this was the case?

In Europe, there was a heavy emphasis on the importance of empirical knowledge, such as science and mathematics, however, these things were not as valued in Aboriginal culture. Europeans, seeing their supposed lack of empirical knowledge as a sign of that their culture was still primitive, they may have described Aboriginal spirituality as rudimentary, without fully understanding the number of truths that were in the Dreaming.

There may have also been a general disposition in European culture at the time to see stories, such as the ones that are passed down in the Dreaming, as “childish”. However, many cultures use oral stories as a means to communicate and pass on complex ideas and anecdotes through generations, as stories have the ability to be engraved within a culture for an extended period of time. Rather, if we were to see the longevity of these stories as an indication for the amount of knowledge they contain, we would find that these stories contain innumerable generations worth of knowledge.
