# Melting and Boiling Point #raw
- Alkanes have low melting points and boiling points
	- Due to the very weak intermolecular forces between molecules
	- Methane to butane are gases in room temperature
- As hydrocarbons lengths increase, the intermolecular forces become greater, increasing boiling and melting temperatures, as well as increasing the viscosity.
- Alkanes with sidechains have higher volatility as their branches decrease the intermolecular forces between molecules

Alkenes are more volatile than alkanes

Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes all have different physical properties as a result of their functional groups.

Alkanes have low melting and boiling points due to the very weak intermolecular forces between their molecules, and methane, ethane, propane, and butane are all gaseous at room temperature.

Alkenes have even lower melting and boiling point than alkanes because of he Van der Waals dispersion forces.

Alkynes have a higher melting and boiling point than the other functional groups.

Boiling Temperature | -ane | -1-ene | -1-yne
--- | --- | --- | ---
meth | -161.6°C | N/A | N/A
eth | -88.6°C | -103.7°C | -84°C
prop | -42°C | -47.6°C | -23.2°C
but | -1°C | -6.3°C | 8.08°C
pent | 36.1°C | 30°C | 40.2°C

Usually, **alkynes** have the highest boiling temperatures, followed by **alkanes**, then finally **alkenes**.
