# Crude Oil #raw 
Crude oil, also known as petroleum, is a liquid form of fossil fuels, which accounts for the majority of the fossil fuels used (32% of global consumption). Crude oil is a versatile resource, which can be turned into:
- Gasoline;
- Diesel;
- Heating oil; and more

[[Fractional Distillation|This is achieved through a process known as fractional distillation, where hydrocarbons of different lengths are separated]].

- Kerogen -> Oil 
- Reservoirs
- Ancient organisms (such as plankton) die and settle on the ocean floor, where they turn into **kerogen** and eventually the extremely sought after **oil**
	- This is due to the high temperature and pressure that they encounter at this depth under the layers of sediment on top.
- Occasionally, they break the surface, but often, are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers, making reservoirs.
- These can be found by seismic surveying and other methods
