- Kerogen -> Oil 
- Reservoirs
- Ancient organisms (such as plankton) die and settle on the ocean floor, where they turn into **kerogen** and eventually the extremely sought after **oil**
	- This is due to the high temperature and pressure that they encounter at this depth under the layers of sediment on top.
- Occasionally, they break the surface, but often, are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers, making reservoirs.
- These can be found by seismic surveying and other methods
