# Alkanes
Alkanes are hydrocarbons that only contain single bonds; when saturated, they can be arranged in straight lines, branched chains, and rings. However, due to the different forms (structural isomers) that these alkanes can take, it is common for two alkanes to have the same chemical formula but have different structures. This is why they have an agreed upon naming convention known as the *[[Naming Conventions for Alkanes|IUPAC Nomenclature for Organic Chemistry]]*.

Different isomers have differing chemical properties, such as different [[Melting and Boiling points for Alkanes|melting and boiling points]].


## Balancing Combustion
1. Write the equation
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
2. First, list the amount of each element on each side:
	- C: 4 / C: 1
	- H: 10 / H: 2
	- O: 2 / O: 3
3. Then balance all other elements **EXCEPT** oxygen, and list the amount of  each element there is
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 4CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
	- C: 4 / C: 4
	- H: 10 /  H: 10
	- O: 2 / O: 13
4. Finally, add the RHS oxygen count to the LHS oxygen, then double everything
	- 2C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + 13O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 8CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
