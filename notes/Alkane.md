# Alkanes
Alkanes are hydrocarbons that only contain single bonds; when saturated, they can be arranged in straight lines, branched chains, and rings. However, due to the different forms (structural isomers) that these alkanes can take, it is common for two alkanes to have the same chemical formula but have different structures. This is why they have an agreed upon naming convention known as the *IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry*.
## Naming convention
Alkane | Chemical Formula
--- | ---
**Meth**ane | CH<sub>4</sub>
**Eth**ane | C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
**Prop**ane | C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>
**But**ane | C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>
**Pent**ane | C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>
**Hex**ane | C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>
**Hept**ane | C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>
**Oct**ane | C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>
**Non**ane | C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>
**Dec**ane | C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub>

Alkanes always end with a "-ane", and has a prefix depending on the amount of carbon atoms there are. As a general rule for the chemical formula for straight line alkanes, it is **C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>**. 
The smallest branch-able alkane is butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), meaning that methane, ethane, and propane cannot have any branches. 

- For branched chains
	1. Find the parent chain (longest continuous)
	2. Number the carbon atoms: from the side with a branch closest to end.
	3. Branches are alkyl groups, add -yl to the prefixes
		- Meth-yl
		- Eth-yl
		- Prop-yl
	4. Add carbon number of the parent group in front of alkyl group
		- 1-Methyl
		- 2-Methyl
		- ...
	5. If there are more than one of the same alkyl groups, then add prefixes "di-" for two, "tri-" for three, "tetra-" for four, etc.
		- 1,2-dimethyl
	6. Arrange it alphabetically (ignore step 5 prefixes)
	7. Fin (e.g. 5-ethyl-3-methyloctane)
## Melting and Boiling Point
- Alkanes have low melting points and boiling points
	- Due to the very weak intermolecular forces between molecules
	- Methane to butane are gases in room temperature
- As hydrocarbons lengths increase, the intermolecular forces become greater, increasing boiling and melting temperatures, as well as increasing the viscosity.
- Alkanes with sidechains have higher volatility as their branches decrease the intermolecular forces between molecules
## Balancing Combustion
1. Write the equation
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
2. First, list the amount of each element on each side:
	- C: 4 / C: 1
	- H: 10 / H: 2
	- O: 2 / O: 3
3. Then balance all other elements **EXCEPT** oxygen, and list the amount of  each element there is
	- C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 4CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
	- C: 4 / C: 4
	- H: 10 /  H: 10
	- O: 2 / O: 13
4. Finally, add the RHS oxygen count to the LHS oxygen, then double everything
	- 2C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10 (g)</sub> + 13O<sub>2 (g)</sub> --> 8CO<sub>2 (g)</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub>
