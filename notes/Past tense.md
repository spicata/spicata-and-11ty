# Past tense
没 and 不 are both commonly used to express actions that have occurred in the past. However, their usage differs, and incorrect usage of them can confuse your audience.

---
没 when used in past tense to express a negative action shows that the action has not happened. For example, saying: *我没吃早饭* means that the speaker has not eaten breakfast that morning.

On the other hand, 不 is usually used to indicate that the negative action is done (or rather, not done) habitually. For example, saying *我不吃早饭* would indicate that the speaker does not eat breakfast on a regular basis.
