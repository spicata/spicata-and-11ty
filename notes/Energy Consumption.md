# Energy Consumption
This is the total amount of energy used to perform any task, which can include: thinking, breathing, staying alive, charging your devices, *anything*. Energy consumption is split into two different types:
1. Direct energy consumption, and
2. Indirect energy consumption.

Direct energy consumption is the energy directly used to do a task, such as the energy that I am expending to move my fingers to type this sentence. Indirect energy consumption, on the other hand, is the energy used in the lead up to a task. For example, the energy that was used in the farming of the foods that I ate to have this energy. 

Indirect energy consumption can essentially be endless depending on how pedantic you wish to be.
