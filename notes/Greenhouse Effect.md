# The Greenhouse Effect #raw
1. Sun produces infrared radiation
2. Some infrared radiation reflects off the atmosphere into *space*
3. Some infrared radiation gets absorbed by the Earth
4. The Earth reradiates it as heat.
	1. Most of the heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gasses and reflected back into Earth (increases kinetic energy)
