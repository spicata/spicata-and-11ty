# Future tenses
There is a distinction between "will not" and "have not yet" in Chinese grammar, and thus it matters whether you use 没 or 不. 

不 is used to show that the speaker (or subject) "will not" do a certain task in the future. For example, *我不去上海* would mean that the speaker **will not** go to 上海 (Shang-Hai).

On the flip side, 没 indicates that the subject is "yet to" do a certain task, which they will do in the future. For example, *他没做数学作业* would mean that he is **yet to** do the maths homework, which he is to finish.

没 can also be used to shown an experience that someone is yet to have. For example, *我没去上海* would mean that the speaker is **yet to experience** 上海.
