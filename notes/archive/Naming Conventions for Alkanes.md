Alkane | Chemical Formula

**Meth**ane | CH<sub>4</sub>
**Eth**ane | C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
**Prop**ane | C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>
**But**ane | C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>
**Pent**ane | C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>
**Hex**ane | C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>
**Hept**ane | C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>
**Oct**ane | C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>
**Non**ane | C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>
**Dec**ane | C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub>

Alkanes always end with a "-ane", and has a prefix depending on the amount of carbon atoms there are. As a general rule for the chemical formula for straight line alkanes, it is **C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>**. 
The smallest branch-able alkane is butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), meaning that methane, ethane, and propane cannot have any branches. 

## For branched chains:
1. Find the parent chain, which is the longest continuous chain. Name this like a straight line alkane.
2. Number the carbon atoms of that parent chain (1, 2, 3…), starting from the side with a functional group closest to end.
3. Name the alkyl groups (branches), by add -yl to the prefixes corresponding to its length, then adding the carbon number of the parent group in front of the alkyl group. e.g.
	- 1-Meth-yl
	- 1-Eth-yl
	- 2-Prop-yl
4. If there are more than one of the same alkyl groups, then add prefixes "di-" for two, "tri-" for three, and "tetra-" for four (If there are more than four, it shares the prefixes: pent, hex, hept…). e.g.
	- 1,2-dimethyl
5. Arrange it alphabetically. When doing so, ignore the step 4 prefixes.
6. Add them all together, e.g. 5-ethyl-3-methyloctane
