# Enthalpy
Enthalpy is the total amount of energy that is in a system, and is often represented by the variable *H*. *ΔH* is used to show enthalpy change, and is calculated by:
> *ΔH = H of product - H of reactants*
## Write it Correctly
When describing the enthalpy change from a reaction, please write it in the form:

\_\_kJ of **heat energy** is *[absorbed from/released to]* the **surroundings** when \_\_ **mole** of *[state] [reactant]* reacts with \_\_ **mole** of *[state] [reactant]* to form \_\_ **mole** of *[state] [reactant]* and \_\_ **mole** of *[state] [reactant]*
