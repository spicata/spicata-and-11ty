## Speech
- As a cockroach, he cannot speak however, he still has insightful introspection and can speak eloquently, as shown in the start, although nobody else but him and us can understand him
	- This shows his presence of education

	- He is unable to aid his family and
	- Everyone is digusted by him
- If considering before times:
	- His relationship with the chief clerk and his family is almost predatory, with him not wanting to do the job but having to provide for them.
## Representation

	- Before his transformation, Gregor represented the average proletariat, who would work due to the demands of his boss (chief-clerk).
		- He was abused by his boss, who, despite him working hard, is still distrustful of Gregor
		- He is solely focused on his job, his first thought after the transformation being: how will I get to work.
