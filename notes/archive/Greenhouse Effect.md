# The Greenhouse Effect
The greenhouse effect is named after a greenhouse, as it does the same thing in principle. In a greenhouse, it can stay warm even after the Sun has gone down, as the glass absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight, and when time comes, reradiates it out as heat. The same thing is achieved by greenhouse gases when in the atmosphere. Hereâ€™s how it goes:
1. Sun produces energy, specifically those of the infrared, visual, and ultraviolet ranges.
2. Some infrared radiation reflects off the Earth into space, whilst some of it gets absorbed by the Earth.
3. Eventually, the Earth reradiates it as heat.
4. Most of the heat is reabsorbed by the greenhouse gases and reflected back into Earth, which causes increasing temperatures.
