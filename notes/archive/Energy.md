# Energy
> First law of Thermodynamics (paraphrased): Energy is neither created nor destroyed
 
**Energy** is essentially the ability to do “work”. [[Energy Consumption|This work can come in a variety of forms, all using a variety of amount of energy.]] Nowadays (2022), the majority of the energy is [[Fossil Fuels|produced by the burning of fossil fuels]], with almost ¾ of the energy consumed originated from it.

However, if we take the total the amount of energy on Earth, the main external source of energy would be from the Sun, with geothermal being the main internal source of energy on Earth.
