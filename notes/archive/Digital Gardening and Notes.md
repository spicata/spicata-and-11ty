# Digital Gardening and Notes
Digital Gardening (or Hypertext Gardens) is a way to present information to others, a structure for your notes, that takes heavy inspiration from parks and gardens.
> “The garden is farmland that delights the senses… The park is wilderness, tamed for our enjoyment.”

Evergreen notes are a form of notes that are contrasted to raw and transient notes. Evergreen notes are constantly worked upon and grown, like an evergreen tree; if not maintained, rotting.

Raw notes are notes that are a direct regurgitation of the learning material. These don’t facilitate growth and connection.

Transient notes are notes that cannot be connected to other notes. In Obsidian terms, they are orphans.

Taking these principle into mind, how will I make my notes better, primarily for me.
## Taking
Taking notes are the most important part to… taking notes. However, notes don’t start evergreen. Becoming evergreen is a process. There is merit to taking raw and transient notes when first recording, thus continue to do this.
## Maintaining
When doing review, make notes into sentences that is readable. Punctuation breaks flow, so reduce it to a minimum unless necessary. Reduce unnecessary bloat (textual bloat). If the raw notes could possibly fit into another note, place it there.
## Structuring
Once maintained, structure the notes well. First, plan it in a book, I believe that will help to reveal the connections in topics between topics. Then, fragment, recollect, collate, and organise as it seems fit. Each note should be atomic, but not tiny.
## Presenting
It is important to not lose the reader’s attention, so reduce the amount of times they have to visit the start page as possible. Do not make links too long to seem that you are wasting time, rather to make them seem like they are taking a better path. I will remove header and many dead ends, as it interrupts the flow of study.
