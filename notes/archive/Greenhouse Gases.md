# Greenhouse Gases
Greenhouse gases are gases that trap infrared radiation, thus trapping heat, sharing its name with greenhouses. These gases are able to absorb infrared radiation due to the molecular bonds, which are able to stretch and bend, which will allow them to reradiate it. Some greenhouse gases include:
- Water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O);
- Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a very important part of atmosphere that controls weather and heat, however excess of which can destroy the environment;
- Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which is better at heat retention than carbon dioxide, but also less common, originating from manufacturing and animals;
- Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), created from factories and farming which is extremely potent; and
- CFCs and HCFCs, which are 100% artificial and utterly destroys the ozone layer.
