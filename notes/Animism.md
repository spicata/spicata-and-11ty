### Animism
: (noun) the attribution of souls to inanimate objects

Aboriginal spirituality is animistic, which entails the attribution of spirits to nature, that can affect the course of it. This puts humans, nature, and animals on equal footing, thus respect is formed.

Respect for the spirits creates gain for society, such that it may bring about rain or aid in hunting. Additionally, disrespect causes loss; an unbountiful harvest, an unfruitful hunt.

Since Aboriginal communities were pre-industrial, the needed to take care of the environment, and treat animals and plants as living, breathing things; not resources to be used.
