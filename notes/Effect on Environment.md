Carbon Cycle
1. Sun produces infrared radiation
2. Some infrared radiation reflects off the atmosphere into *space*
3. Some infrared radiation gets absorbed by the Earth
4. The Earth reradiates it as heat.
	1. Most of the heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gasses and reflected back into Earth (increases kinetic energy)
## Greenhouse Gases
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that trap infrared radiation, thus trapping heat. Some of them include:
- Water Vapor
- Carbon Dioxide - very important part of atmosphere, controls weather, but too much is bad
- Methane - better at heat retention than carbon dioxide, but also rarer. Come from manufacturing and animals
- Nitrous Oxide - from factories and farming, very potent
- CFC - 100 percent artificial, kills the ozone layer
- HCFC
