# Melting and Boiling Point
- Alkanes have low melting points and boiling points
	- Due to the very weak intermolecular forces between molecules
	- Methane to butane are gases in room temperature
- As hydrocarbons lengths increase, the intermolecular forces become greater, increasing boiling and melting temperatures, as well as increasing the viscosity.
- Alkanes with sidechains have higher volatility as their branches decrease the intermolecular forces between molecules

Alkenes are more volatile than alkanes
