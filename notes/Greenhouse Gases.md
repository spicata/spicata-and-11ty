# Greenhouse Gases #raw
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that trap infrared radiation, thus trapping heat. Some of them include:
- Water Vapor
- Carbon Dioxide - very important part of atmosphere, controls weather, but too much is bad
- Methane - better at heat retention than carbon dioxide, but also rarer. Come from manufacturing and animals
- Nitrous Oxide - from factories and farming, very potent
- CFC - 100 percent artificial, kills the ozone layer
- HCFC
