# Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
![[Pasted image 20220726111122.png]]
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a diagram depicting 5 tiers of human needs, each subsequent tier needing the lower ones to have been achieved before being able to be achieved itself. From bottom to top, the tiers are:
1. Physiological needs, including air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing, and reproduction;
2. Safety needs, including personal security, employment, resources, health, and property;
3. Love and belonging, including friendship, intimacy, and family;
4. Esteem, including respect, self-esteem, status, and recognition; and
5. Self-actualisation, the desire to become the most of one can be.

These goals are split into deficiency needs and growth needs. A deficiency need is a need that arises due to deprivation and the incentive to meet these needs lessen as they are more achieved, but increasing the longer it isn't met. 
For example, a person who has not eaten food in a while will feel very hungry, but as they eat more, they begin to feel less hungry; the incentive to continue to accomplish the goal diminishes. 
These needs include:
- Physiological needs,
- Safety needs,
- Love and belonging, and
- Esteem

Growth needs, on the other hand, are needs which increase the more they are fulfilled. The growth needs are:
- Self-actualisation

Maslow believed that humans had the innate desire to achieve self-actualisation, but to achieve them, they need to satiate their more basic needs first. He explains that: "what a man can be, he must be," referring to how humans have a tendency to become self-aware.

Socrates believed in the betterment of the lives of his fellow Athenians through philosophy; similar in idea to the need of self-actualisation in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Socrates believed that humanity had plateaued due to having all their deficiency needs met, and thus made no effort to become the best that one could become, rather opting to simply follow the majority.

On top of that, Socrates believed "The unexamined life is not worth living"
