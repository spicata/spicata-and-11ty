# Distillation
Before jumping into fractional distillation, it is useful to first understand what distillation on its own means.

> Distillation is the act of heating a liquid, evaporating it, and condensing it to get a more pure substance.

Distillation is used to separate a pure liquid from a combination of liquids, and can be used for a variety of things, including:
- Desalinating water;
- Purifying alcohol to increase its strength; and 
- Separating crude oil by its boiling point.

Let's say for example, that we are distilling a mixture of water and ethanol, and we want to acquire as much pure ethanol from the solution. We would:
1. Firstly, heat up the solution to 78.37Â°C (the boiling point of ethanol)
