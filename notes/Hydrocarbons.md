# Hydrocarbons
- Functional groups: is an atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule. Determines pattern of reactivity of homologous series. (Chemical propeties)
- Homologous series: group of molecules of the same functional group but a different number of CH<sub>2</sub>, differs in the number of carbons (Physical properties - boiling point, etc)
- Saturated hydrocarbons: Only contains single bonds between carbon atoms, fairly unreactive

Name | Functional Group
--- | ---
Alkane | None
Alkene | At least one double bond, minimum 2 carbons
Alkyne | At least one triple bond, minimum 2 carbons

## Carbons
- Carbon bonding capacity: 4
## Alkanes
- Saturated hydrocarbons that can be arranged in straight lines, branched chains, and rings
