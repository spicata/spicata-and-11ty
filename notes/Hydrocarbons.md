# Hydrocarbons
As with many things with science, we need to define a few terms before entering the meat of the topic.
- **Functional groups** are an atom or groups of atoms (alkyl groups) that are responsible for the typical chemical properties of a molecule - these functional groups replaces hydrogen atoms within organic compounds.
- **Homologous series** are groups of molecules of the same functional group but containing different number of CH<sub>2</sub> (differing in the number of carbons), thus determining its physical properties: boiling point, melting point, etc
- **Saturated hydrocarbons** are hydrocarbons that only contains single bonds between carbon atoms; due to this, they are fairly unreactive.

Name | Functional Group
--- | ---
Alkane | None
Alkene | At least one double bond, minimum 2 carbons
Alkyne | At least one triple bond, minimum 2 carbons

## Carbons
- Carbon bonding capacity: 4
## Alkanes
- Saturated hydrocarbons that can be arranged in straight lines, branched chains, and rings
### Naming convention
- Smallest branch-able chain is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
- For straight lines:

Alkane | Chemical Formula
--- | ---
Meth-ane | CH<sub>4</sub>
Eth-ane | C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>
Prop-ane | C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>
But-ane | C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>
Pent-ane | C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>
Hex-ane | C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>
Hept-ane | ...
Oct-ane | ...

- Isomer: Organic compounds with same formula but different structure
- Different names, different shapes, different properties.
- For branched chains
	1. Find the parent chain (longest continuous)
	2. Number the carbon atoms: from the side with a branch closest to end.
	3. Branches are alkyl groups, add -yl to the prefixes
		- Meth-yl
		- Eth-yl
		- Prop-yl
	4. Add carbon number of the parent group in front of alkyl group
		- 1-Methyl
		- 2-Methyl
		- ...
	5. If there are more than one of the same alkyl groups, then add prefixes "di-" for two, "tri-" for three, "tetra-" for four, etc.
		- 1,2-dimethyl
	6. Arrange it alphabetically (ignore step 5 prefixes)
	7. Fin (e.g. 5-ethyl-3-methyloctane)
