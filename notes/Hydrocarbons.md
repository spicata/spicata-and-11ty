# Hydrocarbons
As with many things with science, we need to define a few terms before entering the meat of the topic.
- **Functional groups** are an atom or groups of atoms (alkyl groups) that are responsible for the typical chemical properties of a molecule - these functional groups replaces hydrogen atoms within organic compounds.
- **Homologous series** are groups of molecules of the same functional group but containing different number of CH<sub>2</sub> (differing in the number of carbons), thus determining its physical properties: boiling point, melting point, etc
- **Saturated hydrocarbons** are hydrocarbons that only contains single bonds between carbon atoms; due to this, they are fairly unreactive.

Hydrocarbons are split into three homologous series: alkanes; alkenes; and alkynes, the difference being that:

Name | Functional Group
--- | ---
[[Alkane]] | None
[[Alkene]] | At least one double bond, minimum 2 carbons
Alkyne | At least one triple bond, minimum 2 carbons

Carbon is essential to hydrocarbons ~~who could have thought~~, and thus it is essential to know some properties of carbon. Carbon has a bonding capacity of 4, meaning that it can covalently share one electron with 4 other atoms, creating 4 single bonds. This is why alkanes have their distinct shape.
