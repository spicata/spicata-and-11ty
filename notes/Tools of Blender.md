# Tools of Blender
Blender is a amazingly useful application, however, it owes its success to the various tools that can be found on it, which range from simple scales to complex physics animation tools, however, they all require at least some understanding to use these tools.
## Move
In Blender, the **move tool** is one of, if not the most useful tools, as it can be used everyone. It is pretty self explanatory, it is used to move objects. It can be accessed by pressing `G`, which will allow you to start moving the object.

From there, you can press `X` to only move it on the x-axis, `Y` to only on the y-axis, and `Z` for the z-axis. Alternatively, you can also do `Shift+X` to move on both the y and z-axes, `Shift+Y` for x and z-axes, and `Shift+Z` for x and y-axes.
## Scale
The **scale tool** is used to change the scale of an object, such as stretching or shrinking. It is accessed by pressing `S`, which will allow it to start scaling your object. At first it will scale in all 3 dimensions, enlarging or shrinking.

To scale it on only certain axes, you simply have to press `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Shift+X`, `Shift+Y`, or `Shift+Z` similarly to the move tool
## Zooming, Panning, and Rotating
These are three different tools, however, these are essential to moving around the view in the editor.

You scroll on the `MB2` (also known as middle mouse button or `MMB`) to zoom in and to zoom out. This will make the viewing camera to come closer or further in reference to the focal point. To rotate the camera view, hold `MB2` and drag around in the view, which rotates you around the focal point. To pan, hold `Shift+MB2` and drag to pan around.
## Numpad Shortcuts
The numpad is an extremely useful tool in Blender, as it contains many camera controls that streamlines creation. 
### `NumPad 1`, `NumPad 3`, `NumPad 7`, `NumPad 9`
These four keys align the view camera to certain angles based on the 3D-cartesian plane, and switches the type of projection to orthographic. This is used to get a side-on, front-on, top-on, or bottom-on view of the project, which is especially useful when only manipulating objects in certain axes or when editing an object.
### `NumPad 2`, `NumPad 4`, `NumPad 6`, `NumPad 8`
These four keys move the view camera around the focal point by constant increment. `NumPad 2` and `NumPad 8` rotates the camera in an downwardly or upwardly direction respectively. On the other hand,`NumPad 4` and `NumPad 6` rotates the camera towards the left or right direction.
### `NumPad 5`
This button changes the view from perspective to orthographic and vice versa.
### `NumPad 0`
This button changes the focal point to a selected object.
