# 4 - Alpha Decay #Permanent 
Radioactive decay is the process that atoms undergo to become more stable by releasing energy or particles. A type of this is alpha decay, which releases alpha particles ([[4,a - Why does it release alpha particles]]) ($\alpha$ particles), which is identical to a helium nucleus[^1] (two protons and two neutrons.)

Alpha decay is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative[^2], which means that alpha-emitters are relatively safe, and able to be stopped by a sheet of paper. However, it is extremely ionising[^3] due to its mass, meaning that it can wreak havoc on cells when it comes into close contact with them[^4].

Type of Decay | General Formula (A is atomic Mass, Z is atomic number)

Alpha Decay | $^A_{Z}X\to^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y+^4_{2}\alpha$

[^1]: Why is it specifically a helium nucleus?
[^2]: It being slow is due to its mass, but why is it not penetrative? Wouldn’t a more massive particle have an easier time penetrating materials?
[^3]: What does ionisation actually do? *It makes a atom into an ion.*
[^4]: What are the side effects to exposure to $\alpha$ particles?
[^5]: **Elaborate**. Why does it release alpha particles?
