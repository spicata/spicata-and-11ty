# 4 - Alpha Decay #Permanent 
Radioactive decay is the process that atoms undergo to become more stable by releasing energy or particles. A type of this is alpha decay, which releases alpha particles ([[4,a - Why does it release alpha particles]]) ($\alpha$ particles), which is identical to a helium nucleus[^1] (two protons and two neutrons.)

Alpha decay is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative ([[4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative (P)]]), which means that alpha-emitters are relatively safe, and able to be stopped by a sheet of paper. However, it is extremely ionising[^2] due to its mass, meaning that it can wreak havoc on cells when it comes into close contact with them[^3].

Type of Decay | General Formula (A is atomic Mass, Z is atomic number)

Alpha Decay | $^A_{Z}X\to^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y+^4_{2}\alpha$
