# 8,a - Nuclear Waste #Permanent 
Despite what public knowledge may say, nuclear reactor produce very little waste ([[8,b - Types of Nuclear Waste and Storage]]) due to nuclear power’s high energy to fuel ratio[^1], which is effectively contained within containment facilities run by various organisation around the world[^2]. This allows for the safe disposal of nuclear waste, unlike the by-products of fossil fuelled powerplant[^3].

Furthermore, what can be recycled of the depleted radioactive fuels is recycled into more radioactive fuels ([[8,a,a - Nuclear Recycling]]), which can continue to be reused within conventional nuclear reactors[^5].
