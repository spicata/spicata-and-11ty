# <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Naming Convention for Alkenes and Alkynes</mark> #raw
Alkenes and alkynes have essentially the same naming convention to each other, which is [[Naming Conventions for Alkanes|both quite similar to alkanes]], however, there are some differences, so they will be detailed below.

As alkenes and alkynes have one C=C and Câ‰¡C functional groups respectively, their location needs to be known to have the correct molecule, as they would have different chemical properties. Thus, we label them as: alk-$x$-ene or alk-$x$-yne, where $x$ is the carbon number of the carbon with the functional group, and closest to the end. This may be easier to visualise with a diagram.

On the top, we can see but-2-ene, and below, we can see but-1-ene.

- The parent compound is the longest chain containing the double bond
- It is numbered from the end which the C=C is closer
	- But-2-ene
