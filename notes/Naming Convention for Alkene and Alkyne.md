# Naming Convention for Alkenes and Alkynes
Alkenes and alkynes have essentially the same naming convention to each other, which is [[Naming Conventions for Alkanes|both quite similar to alkanes]], however, there are some differences, so they will be detailed below.

As alkenes and alkynes have one C=C and C≡C functional groups respectively, their location needs to be known to have the correct molecule, as they would have different chemical properties. Thus, we label them as: alk-$x$-ene or alk-$x$-yne, where $x$ is the carbon number of the carbon with the functional group, and closest to the end. This may be easier to visualise with a diagram.

On the top, we can see but-2-ene, and below, we can see but-1-ene.

For branched chains, we follow the naming conventions for alkane but with slight modifications:
1. Find the parent chain, which is the longest continuous chain <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">that contains the C=C or C≡C functional group</mark> . Name this like a straight line <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">alkene/yne</mark> .
2. Number the carbon atoms of that parent chain (1, 2, 3…), starting from the side <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">with the functional group (C=C or C≡C) closest to end</mark> .
3. Name the alkyl groups (branches), by add -yl to the prefixes corresponding to its length, then adding the carbon number of the parent group in front of the alkyl group. e.g.
	- 1-Meth-yl
	- 1-Eth-yl
	- 2-Prop-yl
4. If there are more than one of the same alkyl groups, then add prefixes "di-" for two, "tri-" for three, and "tetra-" for four (If there are more than four, it shares the prefixes: pent, hex, hept…). e.g.
	- 1,2-dimethyl
5. Arrange it alphabetically. When doing so, ignore the step 4 prefixes.
6. Add them all together, e.g. 5-ethyl-3-methyloctane

For example, below shows a 3-methylbut-1-ene
