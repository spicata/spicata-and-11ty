>"The unexamined life is not worth living" - Socrates

Socrates was born in Athens, Greece in 470 BC, well known for being put to death for his philosophy (399 BC). Most everything we know about Socrates was due to the *Socratic dialogue* by Plato.

Socrates believed that thinking logically would benefit humanity. He observed that his fellow Athenians often simply followed other - the majority or those of power. Instead, he believed that people should be confident in their own beliefs. 

Following this, he also found that people accept popular opinion, regardless of whether they are well thought out or not. Socrates was against this thought, and believed that humans should think logically and with reason. *In this sense, he would [[Greeks and Democracy|disapprove of modern politics]].*

Socrates would be executed due to his beliefs, drinking hemlock and dying from the paralysis caused.
## Socrates' Pottery
1. Look for common sense statements
2. Find a way to contradict it naturally
	1. If the exception works, then the statement is not true
3. Change initial statement to accommodate contradiction
4. Repeat

This method would take you closer to the universal truth
## tl;dr
- Care of the soul
- Question everything - do not follow the majority (ignorance/stupidity)
- The truth/reason will set you free
- Back yourself up as an individual thinker
