# Energy
> First law of Thermodynamics paraphrased: Energy is neither created nor destroyed
 
- **Energy is the ability to do work**
- Today, commonly from fossil fuel.
	- How?
		- By breaking bonds between atoms (through heat), releasing energy
- Sun is the main source of external energy
- Geothermal is the main internal source
## Energy Consumption
- The total amount of energy used to perform a task such as:
	- Existing,
	- Thinking,
	- Writing this, and
	- Breathing
- There are two types of energy consumption:
	1. Direct energy consumption, the energy directly used to commit a task; and
	2. Indirect energy consumption, the energy used in the lead up to a task

## Hydrocarbons
- Hydrocarbons are a combination of hydrogen and carbon
- Most fossil fuels are hydrocarbons
	- This is since fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient animals and plants
### Fossil Fuels
#### Coal

- Coals are seperated into 4 types:
	- Anthracite, these are awesome;
	- Bituminous, these are good enough;
	- Sub-bituminous, these are not great; and
	- Lignite, these are bad.

- Coal Formation
- There are large deposits of coal in USA, Russia, China, India, and Australia
#### Crude Oil
- Also known as petroleum (and quite liquid as well)
- Can be broken into fractions (?) by fractional distillation (?)
- Turned into:
	- Gasoline;
	- Diesel;
	- Heating Oil; and
	- Jet Fuel

- Kerogen -> Oil 
- Reservoirs
- Ancient organisms (such as plankton) die and settle on the ocean floor, where they turn into **kerogen** and eventually the extremely sought after **oil**
	- This is due to the high temperature and pressure that they encounter at this depth under the layers of sediment on top.
- Occasionally, they break the surface, but often, are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers, making reservoirs.
- These can be found by seismic surveying and other methods
#### Natural Gas
- Natural gas needs close to no processing to be used, being piped from the ground to homes.
- Very concentrated in Russia and Iran.
#### Effect on Environment
- *You already know this.* Increases CO<sub>2</sub> in the air.

Carbon Cycle
##### Greenhouse Gasses
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that trap infrared radiation, thus trapping heat. Some of them include:
- Water Vapor
- Carbon Dioxide
- Methane
- Nitrous Oxide
- CFC
- HCFC
