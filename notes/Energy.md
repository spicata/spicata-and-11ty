# Energy #raw
> First law of Thermodynamics paraphrased: Energy is neither created nor destroyed
 
- **Energy is the ability to do work**
- Today, commonly from fossil fuel.
	- How?
		- By breaking bonds between atoms (through heat), releasing energy
- Sun is the main source of external energy
- Geothermal is the main internal source
## Energy Consumption
- The total amount of energy used to perform a task such as:
	- Existing,
	- Thinking,
	- Writing this, and
	- Breathing
- There are two types of energy consumption:
	1. Direct energy consumption, the energy directly used to commit a task; and
	2. Indirect energy consumption, the energy used in the lead up to a task

## Hydrocarbons
- Hydrocarbons are a combination of hydrogen and carbon
- Most fossil fuels are hydrocarbons
	- This is since fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient animals and plants
