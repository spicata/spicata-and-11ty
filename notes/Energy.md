# Energy #raw
> First law of Thermodynamics paraphrased: Energy is neither created nor destroyed
 
- **Energy is the ability to do work**
- Today, commonly from fossil fuel.
	- How?
		- By breaking bonds between atoms (through heat), releasing energy
- Sun is the main source of external energy
- Geothermal is the main internal source
## Energy Consumption
- The total amount of energy used to perform a task such as:
	- Existing,
	- Thinking,
	- Writing this, and
	- Breathing
- There are two types of energy consumption:
	1. Direct energy consumption, the energy directly used to commit a task; and
	2. Indirect energy consumption, the energy used in the lead up to a task

## Hydrocarbons
- Hydrocarbons are a combination of hydrogen and carbon
- Most fossil fuels are hydrocarbons
	- This is since fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient animals and plants
### Fossil Fuels
#### Coal

- Coals are seperated into 4 types:
	- Anthracite, these are awesome;
	- Bituminous, these are good enough;
	- Sub-bituminous, these are not great; and
	- Lignite, these are bad.

- Coal Formation
- There are large deposits of coal in USA, Russia, China, India, and Australia
#### Crude Oil
- Also known as petroleum (and quite liquid as well)
- Can be broken into fractions (?) by fractional distillation (?)
- Turned into:
	- Gasoline;
	- Diesel;
	- Heating Oil; and
	- Jet Fuel

- Kerogen -> Oil 
- Reservoirs
- Ancient organisms (such as plankton) die and settle on the ocean floor, where they turn into **kerogen** and eventually the extremely sought after **oil**
	- This is due to the high temperature and pressure that they encounter at this depth under the layers of sediment on top.
- Occasionally, they break the surface, but often, are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers, making reservoirs.
- These can be found by seismic surveying and other methods
#### Natural Gas
- Natural gas needs close to no processing to be used, being piped from the ground to homes.
- Very concentrated in Russia and Iran.
#### Effect on Environment
- *You already know this.* Increases CO<sub>2</sub> in the air.

Carbon Cycle
1. Sun produces infrared radiation
2. Some infrared radiation reflects off the atmosphere into *space*
3. Some infrared radiation gets absorbed by the Earth
4. The Earth reradiates it as heat.
	1. Most of the heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gasses and reflected back into Earth (increases kinetic energy)
##### Greenhouse Gasses
Greenhouse gasses are gasses that trap infrared radiation, thus trapping heat. Some of them include:
- Water Vapor
- Carbon Dioxide - very important part of atmosphere, controls weather, but too much is bad
- Methane - better at heat retention than carbon dioxide, but also rarer. Come from manufacturing and animals
- Nitrous Oxide - from factories and farming, very potent
- CFC - 100 percent artificial, kills the ozone layer
- HCFC
