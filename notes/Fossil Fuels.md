- Coals are separated into 4 types:
	- Anthracite, these are awesome;
	- Bituminous, these are good enough;
	- Sub-bituminous, these are not great; and
	- Lignite, these are bad.

- Coal Formation
- There are large deposits of coal in USA, Russia, China, India, and Australia
## Crude Oil
- Also known as petroleum (and quite liquid as well)
- Can be broken into fractions (?) by fractional distillation (?)
- Turned into:
	- Gasoline;
	- Diesel;
	- Heating Oil; and
	- Jet Fuel

- Kerogen -> Oil 
- Reservoirs
- Ancient organisms (such as plankton) die and settle on the ocean floor, where they turn into **kerogen** and eventually the extremely sought after **oil**
	- This is due to the high temperature and pressure that they encounter at this depth under the layers of sediment on top.
- Occasionally, they break the surface, but often, are trapped under the ground by impermeable layers, making reservoirs.
- These can be found by seismic surveying and other methods
## Natural Gas
- Natural gas needs close to no processing to be used, being piped from the ground to homes.
- Very concentrated in Russia and Iran.
