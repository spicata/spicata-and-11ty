# Coal 
Coals are a solid form of fossil fuels, which constitutes 22% of the worldâ€™s energy supply. These coals can be separated into different types: (1) Anthracite, (2) bituminous, (3) sub-bituminous, (4) lignite, and (5) peat[^peat]. These different types of coals varies in moisture content and carbon content, thus differing in the amount of energy that is able to be extracted from it. Anthracite tends to be the most valuable, as its high carbon content is highly desirable, but there is only limited supply due to the intense heat and pressures that it must undergo to be formed.

[^peat]: Peat is not actually a form of coal, however, it gets transformed into coal, so I decided to include it.

## Formation
Coal is formed as organic matter is compacted under millions of year worth of pressure and heat exerted by the Earth. This process begins when: plant matter begins to oxidised to water and carbon dioxide, however, if there is not enough oxygen, the plant matter will not be able to fully decompose, forming peat. Eventually, its carbon concentration continues to rise as more and more as it undergoes more pressure and heat.

There are major deposits of coal in the USA, Russia, China, India, and Australia.
