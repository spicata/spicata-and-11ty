# Oceania by A. P. Elkin
Please note that these aren't my opinions, and just notes from this book. It's pretty hard to find so these notes should be enough. (This version of the book was written in 1969)

- Humans adapt mentally as well as physically
- Humans developed a theory about the world around them since pre-literate times
	- This is religion and philosophy
	- Not always the same
## Philosophy
- Indigenous Australians are pre-literate, their ideas similar to the 'primitive philosophers' of Europe
	- Extremely rudimentry
	- Despite this, they still have intelligence
- Aboriginals have a limited capacity in logic.
	- Argueably not only pre-literate, but also pre-logical.
		- Author disagrees; they have quite logical systems
## Cosmongy
- Recounts how everyone has no comprehension of what came before,
	- This includes Indigenous Australians
	- Shows the Indigenous belief on the creation of the world
	- In this regard, similar to European culture
## Cosmology
- As opposed to cause and effect in European culture, Indigenous Australian's think of the world as a phenoma-based
	- Is this due to the urgency of acquiring food?
	- Not future/forward-thinking, rather thinking of the present more
- Likened to cult in its potency.
- Each part is part/expression of a whole
- Dreamings aren't split into more sub-dreamings
- IA (Indigenous Australian is too long) â‰  Western but getting there
