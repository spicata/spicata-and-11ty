# Oceania by A. P. Elkin
> Is there an Indigenous Philosophy? - (essentially) Elkin

Elkins posits that humans adapted to their environment not only physically, but also mentally; stating that humans across every culture has developed a theory about the world around them since pre-literate times[^2]. This is the roots of religion and philosophy - an aspect of human culture that, although widespread, is never the same. Seemingly inevitably, cosmogony and cosmology was formed over time.

[^2]: This is essentially universal. See [a priori](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_priori) and innate or [a posteriori](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_posteriori)

In 1969, it was widely accept that Indigenous Australians were not only pre-literate - their ideas aligning with the 'primitive philosophers' of Europe[^1] - but also pre-logical; a stance that A. P. Elkin disagrees with. 

[^1]: Colonialists believed that Indigenous Australian culture was extremely rudimentary, despite having intelligence.

This tied into the European beliefs that philosophy required logical thought and ability to create abstraction, and the former belief caused colonists to believe that Indigenous Australians lacked a philosophy.

Nobody has a true comprehension of what came before the Big Bang, the creation of the universe[^3]. This is similarly true for the Indigenous Australians, who believed that the world as we know it now originated from a time of chaos, without form and void; an extremely common belief in religions around the world. 

[^3]: This problem still haunts us today. Even with the advents of modern technologies, we are still unsure of the beginning of the universe.

Immanuel Kent was an extraordinarily influential philosophers during the Enlightenment, who posited that there were things that could be perceived using the your senses, a *phenomenon*; and that there were things that were unperceivable, a *noumenon*. 

However, this idea was not new, as on the other side of the world, the Indigenous Australians were already practicing this belief. The "Dreaming", links the *phenomenon* and the *noumenon* in Indigenous Australian culture, however, unlike Kent's belief, Indigenous Australians thought that the *noumenon* could be influenced.
## Cosmology
- As opposed to cause and effect in European culture, Indigenous Australian's think of the world as a phenomena-based
	- Is this due to the urgency of acquiring food?
	- Not future/forward-thinking, rather thinking of the present more
- Likened to cult in its potency.
- Each part is part/expression of a whole
- Dreaming aren't split into more sub-dreaming
- IA (Indigenous Australian is too long) â‰  Western but getting there
- Over a long period of time, IA have built up a large collection of knowledge
## Epistemology
### Causation:
- Differs to European (but I mean, they were isolated for 80,000 years wdy expect)
### Time:
- In E, time is centred on the individual, and is measured strictly, mathematically.
- In IA, time is not measured this way.
	- Very lax about schedules
	- They will come, eventually
		- Angers anthropologist.
		- But for IA, there is no delay.
	- No account for E time
### Space:
- In E, space is strictly measured in distance
- In IA, who needs distance, if you just know all of it. The entire way.
### Number
- In E, numbers are key
- In IA, not really.
	- As they live in the present, they don't need to keep track of numbers
	- Instead of keeping track, he can describe every single little thing.
		- Not 20 rocks, but 20 different things characterised by... something
### Ownership
- No need for excess
	- Needs are respected

- Universal (similarities) vs Particular (differences)
- [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]
- Every part is a part of the whole
- Dreaming is the whole. There is no sub-dreaming. No super-dreaming
	- On the other hand, a Dao consists of many Dao, and is a part of a bigger Dao
	- What is [[Determinism|determinism]]
		- Is totemism "hard" determinism?
			- It is determined before birth, and it dictates your life
				- you have to care for country

1. Develop an appreciation of Dreaming as a focus of moral philosophy about being-in-the-world or dasein, and being-qua-being
2. To make epistemological connections between Dreaming and other moral philosophical accounts of being/Being in story e.g. Aesop's Fables, Genesis, the Gospels and its parables, the Dao
3. Develop an appreciations of story-telling as a form of knowledge in human life, especially about being, and not just "fiction" e.g. the Jewish Midrash

- IA didn't just come into existence
	- Determinism is weird because otherwise, can people get punished?

- In Greece
	- Kairos -> before the world, a mythic time
		- determinism is kairos-ish, because it is determined by what happened here
	- Chronos -> the world
- In IA
	- The two are inextricably linked, occurring simultaneously

- The flowering of a tree is the sign that yams are ready to be gathered
