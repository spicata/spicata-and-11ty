> Is there an Indigenous Philosophy? - (essentially) Elkin

Elkins posed that humans adapted to their environment not only physically, but also mentally; stating that humans across every culture has developed a theory about the world around them since pre-literate times[^2]. This is the roots of religion and philosophy - an aspect of human culture that, although widespread, is never the same. Seemingly inevitably, cosmogony and cosmology was formed over time.

[^2]: This is essentially universal. See [a priori](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_priori) and innate or [a posteriori](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_posteriori)

In 1969, it was widely accept that Indigenous Australians were not only pre-literate - their ideas aligning with the 'primitive philosophers' of Europe[^1] - but also pre-logical; a stance that A. P. Elkin disagrees with. 

[^1]: Colonialists believed that Indigenous Australian culture was extremely rudimentary, despite having intelligence.

This tied into the European beliefs that philosophy required logical thought and ability to create abstraction, and the former belief caused colonists to believe that Indigenous Australians lacked a philosop 
- Recounts how everyone has no comprehension of what came before,
	- This includes Indigenous Australians
	- Shows the Indigenous belief on the creation of the world
	- In this regard, similar to European culture
## Cosmology
- As opposed to cause and effect in European culture, Indigenous Australian's think of the world as a phenomena-based
	- Is this due to the urgency of acquiring food?
	- Not future/forward-thinking, rather thinking of the present more
- Likened to cult in its potency.
- Each part is part/expression of a whole
- Dreaming aren't split into more sub-dreaming
- IA (Indigenous Australian is too long) â‰  Western but getting there
- Over a long period of time, IA have built up a large collection of knowledge
## Epistemology
### Causation:
- Differs to European (but I mean, they were isolated for 80,000 years wdy expect)
### Time:
- In E, time is centred on the individual, and is measured strictly, mathematically.
- In IA, time is not measured this way.
	- Very lax about schedules
	- They will come, eventually
		- Angers anthropologist.
		- But for IA, there is no delay.
	- No account for E time
### Space:
- In E, space is strictly measured in distance
- In IA, who needs distance, if you just know all of it. The entire way.
### Number
- In E, numbers are key
- In IA, not really.
	- As they live in the present, they don't need to keep track of numbers
	- Instead of keeping track, he can describe every single little thing.
		- Not 20 rocks, but 20 different things characterised by... something
### Ownership
- No need for excess
	- Needs are respected

1. Develop an appreciation of Dreaming as a focus of moral philosophy about being-in-the-world or dasein, and being-qua-being
2. To make epistemological connections between Dreaming and other moral philosophical accounts of being/Being in story e.g. Aesop's Fables, Genesis, the Gospels and its parables, the Dao
3. Develop an appreciations of story-telling as a form of knowledge in human life, especially about being, and not just "fiction" e.g. the Jewish Midrash
