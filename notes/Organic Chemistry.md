- Distillation is the act of heating (into vapour) and condensing (into liquid)
- Separating a pure liquid from a combination of liquids.
- For example, let's say there is a mixture of water and ethanol
	1. Heat the mixture to the boiling point of ethanol and condense the vapour, leaving a mixture of mostly ethanol and a little bit water
	2. Repeat

- **Boiling point**: the temperature at which a liquid boils and turns to vapour
- **Volatility**: The tendency of a substance to vaporize. At a given temperature a more volatile substance will more readily turn to gas at the molecules escape from the surface.
- **Flammability**: Ability to support combustion
- **Flammability relating to volatility**: volatile compounds combust more readily and spontaneously than less volatile compound
- **Viscosity**: A liquid's ability to flow.

- Fractional distillation separates a mixture into a number of different parts called fractions
- A tall column is fixed over the mixture with several condensers coming off at different heights
- The column is hot at the bottom and tall at the top
- Substance with high boiling points condenses at the bottom, those with low boiling points condense at the top

- Crude oil contains hydrocarbons of different lengths.
