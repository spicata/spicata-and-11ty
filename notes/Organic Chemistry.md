# What is Organic Chemistry
Organic Chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds (excluding carbonates and oxides). These compounds form the majority of known compounds; approximately 20 million (20,000,000) carbon-containing compounds are known as of know. 
On the flip side, we have inorganic compounds, those that do not contain carbon atoms. There are about 100 thousand (100,000) known inorganic compounds.

[[Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbons]] are the most basic form of organic compounds, being a combination of hydrogen and carbon **only**. 
Hydrocarbons can be found in crude oil, and it is separated through a process of [[Distillation|fractional distillation]].
