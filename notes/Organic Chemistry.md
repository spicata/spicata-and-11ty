# What is Organic Chemistry
Organic Chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds. These compounds form the majority of known compounds; approximately 20 million (20,000,000) carbon-containing compounds are known as of know. 
On the flip side, we have inorganic compounds, those that do not contain carbon atoms. There are about 100 thousand (100,000) known inorganic compounds.

Hydrocarbons are the most basic form of organic compounds, being a combination of hydrogen and carbon **only**. 
Hydrocarbons can be found in crude oil, and it is separated through a process of [[Distillation|fractional distillation]]. 







- Fractional distillation separates a mixture into a number of different parts called fractions
- A tall column is fixed over the mixture with several condensers coming off at different heights
- The column is hot at the bottom and tall at the top
- Substance with high boiling points (bigger) condenses at the bottom, those with low boiling points (smaller) condense at the top

- Crude oil contains hydrocarbons of different lengths.
- Fractional distillation is separating these hydrocarbons.
- Otherwise, crude oil wouldn't be commercially useful
- Smaller hydrocarbons have smaller intermolecular force, larger hydrocarbons have higher intermolecular form.
- Each tray has bubble traps.
