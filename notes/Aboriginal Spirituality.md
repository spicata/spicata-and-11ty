# Aboriginal Spirituality
Aboriginal spirituality is an incredibly sophisticated “religion” of sorts, containing the famous **Dreamtime**, a moral point of view passed on by oral stories containing virtues that has been passed down for tens of thousands of years. Aboriginal spirituality is many differences from the more familiar Western cultures from the wildly different geography and its isolation for an extremely long time.

However, many of these incredibly deep cultures collapsed due to the colonisation of Australia, and has been lost to time forever, leaving only a fraction of these cultures remaining. However, these cultures maintain a high knowledge barrier, and is insulated/closed off from other cultures. Sadly, English fails to do Aboriginal culture justice, however, as I cannot write any of the Aboriginal languages, this article is in English.
## Animism
: (noun) the attribution of souls to inanimate objects

Aboriginal spirituality is animistic, which entails the attribution of spirits to nature, that can affect the course of it. This puts humans, nature, and animals on equal footing, thus respect is formed.

Respect for the spirits creates gain for society, such that it may bring about rain or aid in hunting. Additionally, disrespect causes loss; an unbountiful harvest, an unfruitful hunt.

Since Aboriginal communities were pre-industrial, the needed to take care of the environment, and treat animals and plants as living, breathing things; not resources to be used.
## The Law
*The Law*, also known as *The Lore* or *Aboriginal Customary Law* is a social contract that Aboriginal societies live by. These include things that people must or must not do, and, unlike European societies with their court structures, it is decided upon by the Elders of a community. However, this Law was fixed, immutable, and constant, much like God in Western religions.
## The Dreaming
The Dreaming, or the Dreamtime, is the Aboriginal's understanding of the world and its creation. It goes:
> In the beginning, the world was very "mixed up", very different to what it is now, however, grand ancestor — anthropomorphs — brought the world into order. Geographical features, animals, and humans, are all descendants of these ancestors[^3]

[^3]: Despite my formatting, this is **not** a quote and is extremely simplistic, and fails to capture the depth of the Dreamtime.

Thus totemism and animism are born.

These deities were believed to be part human (mind), part animal (body), and part supernatural (powers).
## Totemic
: (adjective) relating to or resembling a totem or totems.

A totem is an inherited thing that represents a spirit, that defines person's role in life. A totem might make you a steward of a part of the environment; thus people are responsible for them. Interestingly, these totem can be decided before births.

Totems are often the resting places and descendants of the great beings, which creates a sense of identity in Indigenous culture by allowing them to understand themselves in terms of the totems. These people were obligated to and responsible for totems.

Through the use of totemism, everything in Aboriginal culture became a part of the whole.

There are many totemic ceremonies that can be found in Aboriginal culture, such as:
1. Increase ceremonies, increasing the ties that Aboriginals have to the land;
2. Initiation rites, intitiating people into Aboriginal culture;**
3. Mourning ceremonies, which guides spirits back to their totem site; and
4. Healing and harming ceremonies, which calls on the power of spirits to assist.
## The Colonial Lens
European colonist described Aboriginal cultures as many things, such as stone-age-like, pre-literate, undeveloped, and rudimentary. However, this is because we judged them with capitalist-consumer lens. Rather, if we were to judge them using longevity, we would find that Aboriginal culture would be much older. In fact, [[How did the Indigenous Australians Get Here|Aboriginal culture is now widely accepted to the longest continuous culture(s) in the history of the world. (50,000-65,000 years)]]

This, to some extent, is because they were able to overcome the risk of over-exploiting nature, by utilising and living by the stories of Dreamtime.
