# Fractional Distillation
Some terms that will be useful when learning fractional distillation are:
- **Boiling point**: the temperature at which a liquid boils and turns to vapour
- **Volatility**: The tendency of a substance to vaporize. At a given temperature a more volatile substance will more readily turn to gas at the molecules escape from the surface.
- **Flammability**: Ability to support combustion
- **Flammability relating to volatility**: volatile compounds combust more readily and spontaneously than less volatile compound
- **Viscosity**: A substance’s resistance to flow.

## What is Fractional Distillation
Fractional distillation is distillation that separates a mixture into a number of different parts called fractions. This can be used in all sorts of places, but we will focus on the processing of crude oil.

Before learning fractional distillation, it is useful to know several things about crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of many hydrocarbons of different lengths. These hydrocarbon need to be separated, otherwise crude oil would not be commercially useful nor viable.
Additionally, hydrocarbons of shorter lengths are more volatile, meaning that they have a lower boiling point; on the flip side, longer hydrocarbons are less volatile.

In crude oil processing, a tall column is separated into different trays, which is hotter towards the bottom of the column and cooler at the top. Each layer is divided, and the only way of rising to a higher tier is through a mechanism known as a **bubble trap**. Crude oil undergoes the following steps:
1. It is heated to a high enough temperature (300-400°C) so that the crude oil evaporates.
2. It is then fed into the bottom layer of the column; any remaining liquid is collected (bitumen).
3. As it rises, the temperature drops in each higher tray, so longer hydrocarbons condense.
4. This processes repeat with shorter and shorter hydrocarbons as the height of the column increases.
