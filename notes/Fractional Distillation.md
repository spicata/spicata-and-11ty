# Fractional Distillation
Some terms that will be useful when learning fractional distillation are:
- **Boiling point**: the temperature at which a liquid boils and turns to vapour
- **Volatility**: The tendency of a substance to vaporize. At a given temperature a more volatile substance will more readily turn to gas at the molecules escape from the surface.
- **Flammability**: Ability to support combustion
- **Flammability relating to volatility**: volatile compounds combust more readily and spontaneously than less volatile compound
- **Viscosity**: A liquid's ability to flow.

## What is Fractional Distillation
Fractional distillation is distillation that separates a mixture 

- Fractional distillation separates a mixture into a number of different parts called fractions
- A tall column is fixed over the mixture with several condensers coming off at different heights
- The column is hot at the bottom and tall at the top
- Substance with high boiling points (bigger) condenses at the bottom, those with low boiling points (smaller) condense at the top

- Crude oil contains hydrocarbons of different lengths.
- Fractional distillation is separating these hydrocarbons.
- Otherwise, crude oil wouldn't be commercially useful
- Smaller hydrocarbons have smaller intermolecular force, larger hydrocarbons have higher intermolecular form.
- Each tray has bubble traps.
