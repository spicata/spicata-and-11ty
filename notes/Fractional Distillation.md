# Fractional Distillation
Some terms that will be useful when learning fractional distillation are:
- **Boiling point**: the temperature at which a liquid boils and turns to vapour
- **Volatility**: The tendency of a substance to vaporize. At a given temperature a more volatile substance will more readily turn to gas at the molecules escape from the surface.
- **Flammability**: Ability to support combustion
- **Flammability relating to volatility**: volatile compounds combust more readily and spontaneously than less volatile compound
- **Viscosity**: A liquid's ability to flow.
