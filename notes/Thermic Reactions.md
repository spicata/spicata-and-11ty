Yet again, we need definitions.
- A **system** is the reactants and the products of a reaction
- **Surroundings** is everything outside of the system

## Exothermic
Exothermic reactions are reactions where energy moves from a system to the surroundings, meaning that the temperature of the surroundings increases.

## Endothermic

## Enthalpy
Enthalpy is the total amount of energy that is in a system, and is often represented as *H*. *ΔH* is used to show enthalpy change, and is calculated by:
> *ΔH = H of product - H of reactants*

To determine if a reaction is endothermic or exothermic, the temperature is measured

\_kJ of **heat energy** is [absorbed/released] to the **surroundings** when \_ **mole** of [state] [reactant] reacts with \_ **mole** of [state] [reactant] to form \_ **mole** of [state] [reactant] and \_ **mole** of [state] [reactant]

Enthalpy profile diagram. Note that some energy must go into it for more to come out.

### Catalyst
Catalysts decreases the amount of activation energy that is needed for reaction
