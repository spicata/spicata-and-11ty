Yet again, we need definitions.
- A **system** is the reactants and the products of a reaction
- **Surroundings** is everything outside of the system

## Exothermic and Endothermic
Exothermic reactions are reactions where energy is released from a system to the surroundings, meaning that the temperature of the surroundings increases. Endothermic, on the other hand, are reactions where energy is absorbed from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the decrease.

In short, exothermic reactions have a loss of [[Enthalpy|enthalpy]] in their system, whilst endothermic reactions have a gain of enthalpy in their system.

To easily determine if a reaction is endothermic or exothermic, the temperature of the surrounding can be measured. If it rises, its exothermic; if it drops, its endothermic
### Catalyst
Catalysts lowers the activation energy that is needed for reaction
