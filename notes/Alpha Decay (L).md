# Alpha Decay #Literature 
- Radioactive decay is a process that atoms undergo to become more stable, by releasing energy/particles
- Alpha decay releases alpha particles ($\alpha$ particles), which are identical to a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons)
- It is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative, however, it is extremely ionising.
