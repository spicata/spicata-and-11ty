# Collision Theory
The collision theory was proposed by both **Max Trautz** in 1916 and **William Lewis** in 1918. It was the idea that *particles must collide for reactions* to occur, however there were some additional criteria that had to be met for a reaction to occur:
1. The particles must collide with enough energy (activation energy)
2. They must the right orientation for some reactions

Due to collision theory, there are some factors that influence reaction rate:
- Concentration of the reactants;
- Temperature;
- Surface area; and
- Presence of catalyst
