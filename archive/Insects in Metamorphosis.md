# Insects in Metamorphosis #food4thought 
The transformation of Gregor into an insects is a deliberate choice utilised in *Metamorphosis* to further Kafka’s Marxist ideals. Insects are often seen as weak, insignificant, and small, which are all attributes that can be likened to the individual proletariat under a capitalist society, which devalues the individual worker’s life, instead subservient to the capitalist regime (at least in Marxist ideology).

Another aspect that insects and capitalism shares is the community working together to benefit a select few, as with the queens of an ant colony, and the bourgeoise in capitalist society. However, this relationship is regarded as predatory, as the rich get richer by exploiting the working force, who are crushed (similarly to insects) under the pressures of the system. Kafka thus critiques the capitalist machine who’s sole purpose is to generate wealth.
