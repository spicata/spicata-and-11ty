# The Greeks and Democracy
The Ancient Greeks were distrustful of democracy because they believed that it could have descended into tyranny (dictatorship) easily. This was because democracy relies too heavily on human emotions, which can bring rise to demagogues - a political leader that appeals to desires of the people rather than logic.
