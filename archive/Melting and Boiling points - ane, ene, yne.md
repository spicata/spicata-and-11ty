# Melting and Boiling Point
- Alkanes with sidechains have higher volatility as their branches decrease the intermolecular forces between molecules

Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes all have different physical properties as a result of their functional groups. Alkanes have low melting and boiling points due to the very weak intermolecular forces between their molecules, and methane, ethane, propane, and butane are all gaseous at room temperature. Alkenes have even lower melting and boiling point than alkanes because of he Van der Waals dispersion forces. Alkynes have a higher melting and boiling point than the other functional groups.

As hydrocarbon lengths increase, the intermolecular forces become greater, raising the melting and boiling points of the hydrocarbon, as well as its viscosity. On top of that, hydrocarbons with sidechains have higher volatility as their branches decreases the intermolecular forces between molecules.

Boiling Temperature | -ane | -1-ene | -1-yne
--- | --- | --- | ---
meth | -161.6°C | N/A | N/A
eth | -88.6°C | -103.7°C | -84°C
prop | -42°C | -47.6°C | -23.2°C
but | -1°C | -6.3°C | 8.08°C
pent | 36.1°C | 30°C | 40.2°C

Usually, alkynes have the highest boiling temperatures, followed by alkanes, then finally alkenes.
