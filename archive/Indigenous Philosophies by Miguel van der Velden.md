# Indigenous Philosophies by Miguel van der Velden #raw
## Preface
- One can argue that there is a philosophy underlying action
	- Then, why are there wars and environmental collapses. Can philosophy fix that?
- There are contradictions between Western and Eastern philosophies.
	- How do these relate?
	- Why can neither stop bad things from happening?
## Content
- In Western philosophy, God exists outside of the world (transcendent).
- In Eastern philosophy, God exists within the world (immanent).
- How about… God **is** the world?
---
- (Global) Indigenous philosophy ≠ one thing, instead many things.
	- Native Americans, Indigenous Australians, Arctic people.
- But, as a result of their dependence on the land, they have strong spiritual connection to land
- Very different from “just myths”
	- e.g. World is mother implicates that:
		1. women sustain and create life
		2. the world has a similar role
		3. by further extrapolation, we are children of the world (connection), and learn from it
### What does it mean to be an Indigenous person?
- Being Indigenous is not only about being #1
	- There will always be people before you, and people before those, and those before those.
- It has to do with the connection with land
	- This is why people fought tooth and nail to protect the land
### Monistic, Dualistic, and… both?
- Monistic (common in Eastern philosophy) is the belief that everything is one
	- If we can see distinct things, how can monism be true?
- Dualistic (present in both) is the belief that there exist dualities and oppositions
	- With good arises bad, with sharp arises dull, with large arises small.
	- This bring about an “us” and a “them”, how does one prevent conflict now?
- Indigenous cultures accept complexities
	- Not everything can be categorised.
	- Employ spectrums, allow “irrationalities”
### But why should I care?
1. Philosophy requires seeing from many perspectives.
2. Empowers Indigenous people
3. There is wisdom to be found.
	1. Teaches us a lesson
4. A possible new religion for people to subscribe to
