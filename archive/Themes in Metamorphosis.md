# Themes in Metamorphosis #food4thought 
## Alienation
Metamorphosis firstly explores **alienation**, such as that shown towards Gregor Samsa by his family. Due to being an insect, he is unable to communicate in any meaningful way with his family, and his family finds him repulsive, and thus is separated from his family and his previous life.
## Self-reproach
Gregor Samsa also shows **self-reproach** and **shame** due to his new life as an insect, and his loss of identity due to lack of human interaction. Furthermore, he is ashamed of his own appearance, as reflected by Kafka, who never states what insect he became.
## Paternal relationships
Gregor’s **relationship with his father** seems **tenuous** at best, and his father commits acts of violence towards Gregor as his time as an insect; it is also alluded that their relationship with his father was like this before his "metamorphosis". This is a direct reflection of Franz Kafka's troubled ties with his actual father.

This is even more evident in the choice of the father’s name in Metamorphosis, Herr Samsa, a clear reference to Kafka’s own father, Hermann Kafka.
